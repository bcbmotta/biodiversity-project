# Data Science Foundations Skill Path

## Course Description
    Data Science is one of the most in-demand skillsets that companies are constantly hiring for. This Skill Path will teach you the basics of cleaning, analyzing, and visualizing data. You will learn industry-standard languages and libraries including Python, pandas, and SQL. Along the way, you will create real-world projects to practice and demonstrate your analytics skills.

## Final Project
For this project, you will interpret data from the National Parks Service about endangered species in different parks.

You will perform some data analysis on the conservation statuses of these species and investigate if there are any patterns or themes to the types of species that become endangered.

During this project, you will analyze, clean up, and plot data as well as pose questions and seek to answer them in a meaningful way.

## Project Scope
- Analyse the given data about endangered animal;
- Create visual plots to connect the information within the data sets;
- Answer some questions on the data to look for insights, such as:
    - What is the distribution of conservation_status for animals?
    - Are certain types of species more likely to be endangered?
    - Are the differences between species and their conservation status significant?
    - Which species were spotted the most at each park?
- Create a slide presentation with project analysis and conclusions.
